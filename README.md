# Gemuani — Recipe Discovery App

Gemuani is a modern, responsive recipe discovery web application built with React.  
It allows users to explore random recipes, search for dishes, read blog content, and view detailed recipe instructions using data from the Spoonacular API.

This project was built as part of my frontend learning journey.
